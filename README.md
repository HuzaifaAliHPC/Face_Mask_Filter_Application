## 1. Project Overview

Welcome to our Computer Vision project! 
This application is designed to interact with a webcam, capture frames, and allow users to overlay a face mask on the selected frame. 
Users can then save the resulting image with the face mask. This README provides detailed information on how to use and set up the application.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before using the application, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Python 3.6 or higher installed.
- OpenCV library installed. You can install it using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python


## 3. Installation

To install the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HuzaifaAliHPC/Face_Mask_Filter_Application.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd your-computer-vision-project

## 4. Usage

To use the application, follow these instructions:

1. Run the application:
```bash
python face_mask.py


2. The application will open your webcam feed.

3. Press the "c" button to capture a frame. The captured frame will open in a new window.

4. Use your mouse to position the face mask on the captured frame.

5. Press the "s" button to save the image with the face mask applied.

## 5. How it Works

The application leverages computer vision techniques to interact with your webcam and capture frames.
It allows you to overlay a predefined face mask image on the selected frame.
The "s" button triggers the image-saving functionality, ensuring that you can keep the photos you create.
